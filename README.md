# tex-templates
This repository has some useful LaTeX templates that I have used for many years now. 

  The reports/ directory has a bunch of simple templates that can get you started on writing any report or assignment. To compile use pdflatex. 
  
  The presentation/ directory has a few templates with simple beamer themes that can be a useful start to create a slide-stack right away. To compile use pdflatex
  .
  
  The thesis/ directory has a bunch of TeX files for writing a full-fledged thesis. It also has a final pdf version to give you an idea of what you can expect. I adapted these files from the [MIT thesis](https://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/) to write [my PhD thesis](https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/775112). [Ajay Mandyam Rangarajan](https://www.aices.rwth-aachen.de/en/people/rangarajan) also contributed to the MWE that lives in this directory now. To compile simply run python3 run.py.
